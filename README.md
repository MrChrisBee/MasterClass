Hello,
this is a Attemp to get a solid base for preperation for a test. 
It should be easy to create a new Instance of MasterClass whitch then should be deployed 
and this way could be used for training in this special field.  

Parts that are in this should be 
- data e.g. a csv file (dirty data that you have to clean up)
- very basic steps witch has to be done to/with the data 

All this should be presented in a Jupiter Notebook witch should be open to all. 

All here is just a test, it's not running now.
